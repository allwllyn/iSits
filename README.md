	Finding a free table on campus can sometimes be difficult. This is especially true during peak lunch hours. 
	My app is intended to help GSU students quickly find someone who may have a full table to themselves, and is willing to share it.
	The app has 4 main screens: the home screen, the seat list, seat info, and user profiles. 
	The home screen displays the locations that are served by the app. When a location is clicked, the seat list screen is displayed. 
	This shows seats that people are offering in the selected location. 
	Click on of the seats, you can see a more detailed description along with how many seats are open there, in case you want to bring a friend, and if the person is open to chatting or prefers the table to stay quiet. 
	From the seat info screen, you can view the profile of the person offering the seat. The home screen also has a leading chair button, that will show the user the current seat that they are offering, and it can be deleted here. Each user can only submit one seat at a time. If a user attempts to post multiple seats at once, the new one will just overwrite the old one.
